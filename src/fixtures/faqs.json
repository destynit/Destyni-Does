      "body": "Growing up amidst the social media boom, I was exposed to various blog platforms at a young age - it was what all the cool kids were doing! Through Myspace, Facebook, and Tumblr, I found such sentimental value in documenting my creations. I find it incredibly heartwarming to look back on past events and projects to remind myself of all the things I have been capable of accomplishing!"
